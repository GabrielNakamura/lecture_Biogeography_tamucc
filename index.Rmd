First, a little bit about who I'm outside the walls of university...

## What influences the distribution of biological diversity on earth?

???
Basically, this is the question that I've trying to answer with my work, in my research career

--

### Reliable description of biodiversity patterns accross space and time

???
To answer this question I divide my work in two different research lines, that are complementary related with each other, the first one is focus on the development of numerical tools that can provide reliable description of biodiversity patterns accross space and time, focus mainly in patterns that occurs in large spatial and temporal scale,  with special focus on the development of numerical methods that allowed to describe alpha and beta diversity patterns.

--

### Search for the factors that generate these patterns

???
And complementary I use try to find which factors explain these patterns, focused mainly on processes related to the evolution of organisms like speciation and historical dispersal.

## What influence the distribution of biological diversity on earth?

???
As I said, capture effectively biodiversity patterns is just one 
step towards the understanding of the causes of biodiversity distribution on earth

--

### From patterns to process: searching for the causes

???
To fully answer this question we need to explain biodiversity patterns by searching for what generates it

--

#### How historical factors affect the current distribition of biological diversity?

???
And in the last year this is what I'm trying to do, specifically I'm interested in understand how processes associated with speciation and historical dispersal are responsible to generate the current patterns of
distribution in biological diversity

## Some real-world examples

???
To do so Now I'm developing numerical methods in historical biogeography that disentangle the importance of in situ speciation
and historical dispersal to generate spatial patterns in Phylogenetic diversity of assemblages

- Development of .green[Model-based] Phylogenetic metrics

- Unification Macroecology, Macroevolution and Community Ecology
]

???

Briefly I started to adapt common metrics used in community ecology, like PD and PE, and merge this metrics with macroevolutionary models, like ancestral area reconstruction, to be able to capture historical process.

For those who want to see more about the technical details, you can access github codes for this project and the package that Im calling, just for now, as Rrodotus.
